# Connor Sanderford
I'm Connor - a bioengineering student at Arizona State University, and a graduate of the data science program at Lambda School. I've previously worked as a Team Lead for Lambda School, leading a group of students through the data science curriculum.


Currently interested in: 
- Matrix factorization models, especially applying them to domains outside recommender systems.
- Strategies for high-dimensional, sparse data.
- L1-norm optimization.
- Functional programming.

I'd like to contribute to projects as a machine learning engineer or data engineer.
