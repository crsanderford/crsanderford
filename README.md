# Connor Sanderford

I'm Connor - a bioengineering student at Arizona State University, and a graduate of the data science program at Lambda School. I've previously worked as a Team Lead for Lambda School, leading a group of students through the data science curriculum.


### üí° Currently interested in: 
- Matrix factorization models, especially applying them to domains outside recommender systems.
