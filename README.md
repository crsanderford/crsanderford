I'm Connor - a bioengineering student at Arizona State University, and a graduate of the data science program at Lambda School. I've previously worked as a Team Lead for Lambda School, leading a group of students through the data science curriculum.

 - Currently interested in: 
    - matrix factorization models, especially applying them to domains outside recommender systems.
    - Strategies for high-dimensional, sparse data.
    - L1-norm optimization.
    - Functional programming.
